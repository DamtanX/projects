# Introduction

These two dashboards were designed for job seekers to address a common challenge: job market information is often scattered and difficult to interpret. By leveraging a real-world 2024 dataset of data 
science job postings (covering titles, salaries, and locations), the project delivers a clear and accessible way to explore industry trends and compensation patterns.

# Background

# Tools I Used

This projects were a hands-on journey with **Power BI**, applying a wide range of features to turn raw data into interactive **insights**:

- **Power Query (ETL)**: Cleaned, transformed, and shaped the dataset by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.

- **Data Modeling**: Built efficient models with relationships, applying Star Schema principles for better performance and scalability.

- **DAX Calculations**: Created custom measures and aggregations (e.g., Median Salary, Job Count, KPIs) to extract key insights.

 **Visualizations**:

- **Core charts** (Column, Bar, Line, Area) to compare trends and distributions.

- **Map charts** for geospatial analysis of job locations.

- **Cards & KPI** indicators to highlight critical metrics.

- **Tables** for detailed, sortable data views.

- A mix of common and uncommon **chart** types for effective storytelling.

- **Dashboard Design**: Focused on creating a clear, intuitive, and visually engaging layout.

 **Interactivity**:

- **Slicers** for dynamic filtering.

- **Buttons & Bookmarks** for smooth navigation and customized report views.

- **Drill-Through** designed as a button labeled “Find out Job Details”, allowing users to move from a high-level summary directly into detailed job insights.

# Project #1

This **Power BI** project analyzes the 2024 data job market using a real-world dataset of job postings. I designed two interactive **dashboards**:

1. **Overview Dashboard** – Highlights key KPIs like median salaries, job count, top-paying roles, and job posting trends.

2. **Drill-Through Dashboard** – Activated via the “Find Out Job Details” button, providing job-specific insights such as location, work-from-home availability, degree requirements, and benefits.

The project showcases my skills in **Power Query (ETL), data modeling, DAX measures, and dashboard design**, combining analytics with clear storytelling.

**Key Insights:**

- **Top-Paying Roles**: Senior Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers lead with median salaries above $150K.

- **Market Trends**: Job postings peaked early in 2024 (~55K in February) but declined steadily to ~14K by November.

- **Job Distribution**: Most opportunities are concentrated in North America and Europe, with full-time positions making up 91% of listings.
